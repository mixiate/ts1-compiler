TS1 Compiler is a command line replacement for [The Sims Transmogrifier's](https://web.archive.org/web/20111109090310/https://www.thesimstransmogrifier.com/Transmogrifier.htm) import function. It also includes functionality to split and palettize the renders made with [TS1 Renderer](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-renderer).

## Use with the TS1 Renderer add-on for Blender
Whilst you can use the TS1 Compiler from the command line, it is primarily designed to be used with the [TS1 Renderer](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-renderer) add-on for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Documentation on how to use this can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-renderer/wiki).
